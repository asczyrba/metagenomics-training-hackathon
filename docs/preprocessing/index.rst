Data treatment/pre-processing
=============================

* Quality
* Filtering Reads
* Trimming Reads
* Contamination
* Barcodes / multiplexing
* Read Merging

Learning Objectives
-------------------
* Assess the overall quality of NGS (FastQ format) sequence reads
* Visualise the quality, and other associated matrices, of reads to decide on filters and cutoffs for cleaning up data ready for downstream analysis
* Clean up adaptors and pre-process the sequence data for further analysis
